			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Learning to pseudocode as practice for coding</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Some problems that we faced were figuring out an everyday task that was also unfamiliar to most people. Another problem was breaking that task down into a broad yet descriptive list. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I now feel more prepared to use proper coding languages in future assignments. This lab made me think carefully about inputting information, which will help me with future assignments. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"> <pre><code>
						// Task 1: Taking photos on a DSLR

							// Research cameras and lenses
								// Talk to photographers and camera experts
							// Acquire digital camera of choice
								// Acquire SD card
							// Read manual and learn how to operate camera
								// Test equipment and make sure it is working properly
							// Look for places and people to photograph
							// Using what youâ€™ve learned from the manual, press the shutter button and take a photo

						// Task 2: Pseudocode of a simple game (snake game) 
						
							// Generate snake
							// snake starts at a certain size
							// Generate movement abilities 
					  	// Generate random items on grid
							// Snake can pick up items and grow longer
					 	 // If the snake runs into wall or its body, player gets a gameover
