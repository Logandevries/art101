					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to use javascript to experiment with arrays and objects with a partner.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> A minor problem I faced was when I had to define "myMainRide" using the vehicle I described for the previous lab, because I made up the vehicle. So the "myTransport" array I created did not include the vehicle I used for "myMainRide". A larger problem I had was when my output for the lab's JS script wouldn't work, but I realized that I mistyped a function and corrected it. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I thought this lab went relatively well. My partner and I were able to follow the instructions and progress through the designated tasks with little difficulty. </p>
