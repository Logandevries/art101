					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to work with a partner and create functions that take user input and manipulate strings.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> A problem I faced was the text prompt to enter my name appearing twice, but I solved this issue by fixing errors in my declared variables. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I successfully coded a page that uses JavaScript functions to ask the user for their name and then output an answer. </p>
